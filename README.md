This repository includes all Powershell scripts that I use for testing Elastic stack logging functionality on Windows endpoints. This basic set of scripts will set off a variety of alerts on an endpoint with either Winlogbeat/Sysmon or Elastic Agent. This can be used to ensure that Elastic Security is functioning properly or provide a set of alerts and fake activity for individuals to investigate when learning how to use Elastic as a SIEM tool.
